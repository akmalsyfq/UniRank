<h2>UNIVERSITY UTARA MALAYSIA (UUM)</h2>
<div class="container_text">
<div class="text"><p>The Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM: Northern University of Malaysia) 
    was established on 16 February 1984 under the Universiti Utara Malaysia 
    1984 Order. The university was corporatised on 23 April 1998.
    It is in Sintok, Kedah. It is known as a management university.
    The construction planning began in August 1983 when the Ministry of Education 
    began to plan the university. On 19 October 1983, the Cabinet gave its approval 
    for this project in Kedah. At that time, the project was called "The Sixth University Project". 
    Several months later, the temporary office of the Sixth University, officially named Universiti 
    Utara Malaysia (UUM), was officially opened on 15 February 1984 in Jitra.Four months after its official 
    opening, the UUM office was relocated to the provisional Darul Aman Campus in Jitra, in June 1984, when 
    the first phase of the project had been completed. The first academic year began in June 1984. The Darul
     Aman Campus was on a 62-acre tract of land in Bandar Darulaman. It was 18 km north of Alor Setar and
      4.8 km from Jitra.Meanwhile, the planning of a permanent campus had begun. It was to be built on an 
      area of 1,061 hectares in Sintok (in the district of Kubang Pasu), 48 km north of Alor Setar and
       10 km east of Changlun, a small town along the North-South Highway, near the Malaysia-Thai border.
       The permanent UUM campus, referred to as the Sintok Campus, began operations on 15 September 1990.
        In a former tin mining area, it is in a valley of lush tropical forests, embraced by blue hills, 
        and watered by two rivers that flow along the middle of the campus. The rivers are Sungai Sintok
         and Sungai Badak.</p></div></div>
